# CS520_operation_system
Write the bus simulation, it is a simulation of asynchronous processes(Queuing Systems).
There are two parts in the design of operating systems. They are queuing model and simulation mechanisms.
In simulation mechanism, There are random number generation, event generation, event processing and statistics gathering.
The purpose of the simulation is to observe the behavior of the system.
